# Introduction

Swapping is a kind of process in which, A user picks an input token and get an output token. They specify an input amount, and the Brainaut protocol automatically calculates how much of the output tokens user will receive. They then execute the swap by clicking the "Swap" button, and immediately user receives the output token in the wallet.

Swapping the BEP-20 Token is quite easy in Brainaut Protocol.

Brainaut protocol is a decentralized trading platform. Brainaut does not use an order book to represent liquidity or determine prices. Brainaut uses an automated market maker mechanism to provide instant feedback on rates and slippage.

In this guide, we’ll look at what happens during a swap at the Brainaut protocol level to gain a deeper understanding of how Brainaut works.

This rule is the [constant product formula](/docs/v1/protocol-overview/glossary#constant-product-formula). When either token is withdrawn (purchased), a proportional amount of the other must be deposited (sold), to maintain the constant.

As we learned in [Protocol Overview](/docs/v1/protocol-overview/how-brainaut-works), each pair on Brainaut is actually underpinned by a liquidity pool. Smart contracts are used to maintain the Liquidity Pools of different Tokens.

## Anatomy of a swap

In Brainaut, all the Swaps are get done by calling the single function of `swap`:

```solidity
function swap(uint amount0Out, uint amount1Out, address to, bytes calldata data);
```

# Receiving tokens

As is probably clear from the function signature, Brainaut requires `swap` callers to _specify how many output tokens they would like to receive_ via the `amount{0,1}Out` parameters, which correspond to the desired amount of `token{0,1}`.

# Sending Tokens

What’s not as clear is how Brainaut _receives_ tokens as payment for the swap. Typically, smart contracts which need tokens to perform some functionality require callers to first make an approval on the token contract, then call a function that in turn calls transferFrom on the token contract. This is _not_ how pairs accept tokens. Instead, pairs check their token balances at the _end_ of every interaction. Then, at the beginning of the _next_ interaction, current balances are differenced against the stored values to determine the amount of tokens that were sent by the current interactor. See the <a href='#' rel='noopener noreferrer'>whitepaper</a> for a justification of why this is the case.
